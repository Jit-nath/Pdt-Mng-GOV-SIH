### Overall Project Understanding:

- **CMPDI** monitors each project, focusing on financial and physical progress.
- Projects are classified into:
  - **S&T Projects:** Funded by the Ministry of Coal (MoC).
  - **R&D Projects:** Funded by Coal India Limited (CIL).
- S&T projects are monitored in meetings like the Technical Subcommittee and SSRC.
- R&D projects are monitored in meetings like the Apex Committee and R&D Board.
- **Project Investigators (PIs)** submit quarterly reports, including progress, fund utilization, time extension requests, etc.
- Each project might have around 100 reports with over 1,000 data fields to be filled.

### Key System Features:

- Develop a **responsive, secure web application** for tracking and updating project details.
- The system should allow recording every step until project completion.

### Project Investigator (PI) Console:

  - **Activity Timelines:** Includes project creation date, end date, reporting dates, and report details.
  - **Schedule Table:** Timelines for tasks and milestones.
