# Background:

CMPDI is the nodal agency for assessing and monitoring of the various R&D projects (funded by CIL) and S&T projects (funded by S&T).<br>
The monitoring of each projects is performed by checking the financial and physical progress certificates submitted in prescribed forms as per S&T guidelines.<br>
It also intervenes in case any hindrances are observed /expected which can affect the project activities and timeline.<br>
The projects are classified in two, based on its funding i.e. S&T projects funded by MoC and R&D projects funded by CIL.<br>
The progress of the S&T projects is being monitored in the various Meetings such as Technical Subcommittee meeting, and SSRC meeting for S&T projects, and that of R&D projects in Apex Committee and R&D Board.<br>
The directions/ instruction/suggestion given in the above meetings are to be updated for each projects.<br>
As per guidelines, the PI of the projects has to submit the quarterly progress reports along with fund utilisation reports or time extension or additional funds in prescribed forms.<br>
The projects wise information’s/ quarterly progress reports of about more than 100 such reports in each quarter are received through mail and post and are maintained in physical files.<br>
The data in the above reports which consists of more than 1000 data fields is to be updated manually on the data sheets which consumes a lot of time, manpower and have chances of human errors.<br>

# Description:

The objective is to develop a web based software app suited for windows, android, and Mac, which will incorporate each and every steps/activities involved during the progress of the research projects till it official completion/ closure and maintain the whole database in a defined server for audit and scrutiny.<br>

# Expected Solution:

A web based software app is required to be developed which will authorise the sanctioned project’s proponents to enter data and update the project’s status through the app on PC and phone including all the forms, activity wise time line, schedule table, details of fund utilisation, other necessary input etc.

## Admin Console :

An admin console, to be handled by CMPDI, will also be developed for the following: Creation of unique project code based on the funding and other criteria after approval of the project.<br>
Other information such as Title of the projects, Name of Principal Implementing Agencies, Name of Sub-Implementing Agencies, Name of the Project Investigator(s), Project Co-ordinator, Project Investigator, Duration of the projects, project outlay (Agency wise & Head wise), start date, Schedule completion date, etc.<br>
On completion, the admin should have the control to set the final status.<br>
Official communication on the specified email ids of the authorised project co-ordinators or investigators of implementing/ sub-implementing agencies through Email for Delays, Meetings, revisions etc.<br>

## Research Investigator Console:

For the inspector of the sanctioned project, Initial information of the sanctioned projects will be provided by CMPDI through the admin console and will authorise the investigators with their E-mail or Mobile no<br>.  
to access their project information and for further updates as mentioned above.<br>
The investigator authorised shall receive a unique username and password to access their projects.<br>
The investigator will input the desired details such as personal information, bank details of institute/ Organisation of the projects, institutions and the co- investigators in the developed platform and upload necessary documents (the details of the information to be submitted will be provided).<br>
The investigator shall submit the progress of projects in prescribed forms as per S&T guidelines (forms will be provided separately), and subsequently receive digitally generated forms which shall be uploaded after competent authorization.<br>
The investigator shall submit Annual Audited statement certified by an authorised auditor and data on interest earned along with basis of calculation of interest amount The app should allow project proponents to input data through PC or mobile.<br>
The app should further have provision for sending messages as internal chat with the Admin(CMPDI) and E-mails, in case, deadline for quarterly status submission are missed, and the necessary data along with signed documents have not been uploaded for a particular project.<br>
On comp_letion of the project, the proponent should upload necessary documents required before and after the project completion.
Any modification in the input data should be locked after submission and generation of forms.<br>
